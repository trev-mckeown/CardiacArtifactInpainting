# CardiacArtifactInpainting

Download the pix2pix model found at https://github.com/matlab-deep-learning/pix2pix

From this download, you should be able to get the baseline version of pix2pix and after running the install.m file the general pipeline for pix2pix will be set up


After intalling the baseline version of pix2pix, download the p2ptrain_cardiac.m and save it to the code\code\+p2p location for use.

For this file to work you will also need to download the crateUnet3dLayers_cardiac.m file and add that to your path. Suggested location is within the p2p install under code folder
